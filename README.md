 <h2>Deep Learning:</h2>
This project is a fish freshness detection system built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deployed through a Flask API. The system is designed to analyze fish images and classify their freshness level into two categories: Fresh and Not Fresh. The project was developed using Python, with the CNN model trained on a labeled dataset containing a total of 4,880 images. The API was created to integrate the model for real-world usage.
